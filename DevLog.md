# NXP Cup 

**Brief summarized development log(diary):**  [Markdown syntax](markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### October 8th:
The very first meeting of the industrial project group. We get introduced with the [NXP project](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/), make acquaintance with out tutor and know the colleages from the same lab room.
We also receive some materials like codes and reports from the last year group. With that we are able to get some useful infomation and make a general plan for this project.

### October 15th:
1. Work on different compiling environment(Download softwares...) 
2. We divide the group and try to understand the framework of the project.  

### October 22nd:
1. Complete the team registration. 
2. Check the latest rules of the NXP racing competition. 
3. Still work on the [build environment](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames/developerguide/tools/mcuxpresso). 
4. Accomplish installing and running the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=quick_start) simulation and QGroundControl. 

> ### November 16th:
> **Idea of PID control method:** 
> The car is constantly running forward with a set velocity, then controls the steering in order to keep the car in track. 
> Once the car is running successfully, then 1)increase the velocity 2)minimize the overshoot and maximize the respond speed
> 1. extract a line from the camera image
> 2. calculate the two distances between the car and both sides
> 2. compare the d, use the error as the input for controller
> 2. adjust the PID parameters 

### November 19th:
1. Got access to [NXP Course](https://courses.iealearning.org/courses/course-v1:IEA+NXP+2021/course/). 
2. Worked on settings up [NXP Gazebo](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/gazebo/milestone-1-intro-to-nxp-gazebo-and-ros/installation-of-nxp-gazebo-1) environment

We had an online meeting with the other teams instructors and got access to the online course. This helped us build up the knowledge framework and provided indexes of many materials.

### Novenmber 26th:
We successfully set uo the Gazebo simulator. But the repository from NXP CUP summer camp didn't work as our expectation
### December 3rd:
